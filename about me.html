                <p>I am an AI Developer at DareeSoft. My work and research are particularly utilized in fields like HDR (High Dynamic Range) and image segmentation.</p>
                <p>I am expected to graduate from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Kyungpook National University in February 2026. My current GPA is 4.11/4.5.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate years, I was a member of BITDOL (Hardware Research Group), where I was responsible for various projects. Through this experience, I designed projects and handled embedded systems such as NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi.</p>
                <p>My journey in computer vision began in Professor Seonghak Lee's Vision & Imaging Lab, where I was greatly impressed by the power of creating value through software. This led me to conduct research on maintaining clarity in low-light images. I am particularly interested in developing applications that enhance low-light images in real-time by integrating computer vision with embedded systems.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include swimming, running, jiu-jitsu, and boxing. Feel free to reach out!</p>
